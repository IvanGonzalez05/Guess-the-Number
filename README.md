# Guess-the-Number

## How to Play
At the start, the game will generate a random number. The goal of the game
is to guess that number (as its name suggests).

If you guess the number, you can click on "Again" to start another round.

## The Objective
The purpose of this project was to practice Javascript and interact a little bit with the DOM (That's why is not responsive).
